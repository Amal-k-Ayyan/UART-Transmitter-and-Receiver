# UART-
UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It is a type of hardware communication protocol commonly used for serial communication between two devices with different clock domains.
I used a clock frequency of 50MHz for the receiver with a baud rate of 19200.
Hence number of clock pulses required for 1-bit, N = (Time for which 1-bit is high)/(Time period of clock)
                                                = (clock frequency)/(Baud rate)
