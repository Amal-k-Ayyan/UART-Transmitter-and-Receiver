# UART-
UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter. It is a type of hardware communication protocol commonly used for serial communication between two devices with different clock domains.
I have implemented a UART receiver module with a clock frequency of 50MHz each for the receiver and transmitter with  baud rate of 19200 in verilog HDL.
Hence number of clock pulses required for 1-bit, N = (Time for which a single bit is high) รท (Time period of clock)
                                                = (clock frequency) รท (Baud rate)
